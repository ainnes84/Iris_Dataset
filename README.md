# Iris_Dataset

This project was created to demenstrate and further my knowledge in Python through the use of the well-known Iris
Iris Dataset.  Since this is our first project we copied and tweaked a previouly created project from Kaggles.
The one I used can be found here following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/python-data-visualizations.

## Install

You'll need to have Python 3 in order to run this project and the following Python libraries installed:
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Pygal

### Files

* Iris Data Visualizations.ipynb - Main file that looks through all the data using Pandas
* Iris.csv - The data in csv format.
* SVG Files: Charts from using Pygal


### Kaggle Notebook Page

Note: There is no pygal charts in kaggle as kaggle does not support pygal.  I have however added them into this github post to show
some of my knowledge using pygal with Python.
